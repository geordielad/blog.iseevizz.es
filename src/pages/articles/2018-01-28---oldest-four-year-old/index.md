I tell people I am Tableau's oldest Script Kiddie. I have a degree in Software Engineering but I have never been a professional developer or programmer. I am not saying I create scripts to attack computer systems or deface websites. What I am saying is that I am unskilled in virtually all the technical skills required of a modern developer. But I can copy/paste code like a Pro. I have copy/pasted in many popular languages like Python, Javascript and SQL. Some languages I have copy/pasted are not so popular or gone forever - MDX, Occam, Pascal, DBase. 

When I learned the term _Script Kiddie_ something resonated. I think I liked the _Kiddie_ part. I have never wanted to me a manager or a CEO. I love being an 'individial contributer' I love learning. I am perpetually curious and in awe of nearly everything. Learning is one of my strengths. I learn by doing, trying, questioning and arguing (often arguing with myself).

Scipt Kiddies are usually teenagers but I realised that my approach to learning and my curiosity and excitment about things are the traits of a four year old. Maybe that's why I have never felt comfortable as a manager. Would you let a four year old manage a team, or run a company? Most of of my past managers had the good sense not to let me manage.

But I had an epiphany to other day. This is one advantage of being like a four year old - you have epiphanies all the time! I realised that Tableau was founded by a bunch of four year olds. That might sound like a firing offense but I believe our founders are highly creative individuals. They have the traits that most four years. Most of are forced to suppress these traits when we 'grow up'. Now I think about it Tableau has more four year olds than any other company I have ever worked in. How Cool is That!

I am proud to be Tableau's oldest four year old. Maybe that is how I will introduce myself in the future:

Hello, my name is Robin - I am Tableau's oldest four year old.
