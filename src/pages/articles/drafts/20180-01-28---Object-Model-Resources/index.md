## Introduction

During the Kickoff meeting I started wondering how diverse our experience and world view must be in all the areas that are will influence the design and implementaion of the Object Model. I realised that many of you may be new(ish) to data modelling. We are all new to Data Modelling by end users. And, I do not beleive Design is something you do then hand-off to the next phase. 

Here is a list of stuff related to Data Modelling and Design. If you ask me which one book to read out of this list I would say [End of Average] becuase it decribes how we will think about data in the future (and hopefully you have already read at least one book by Don Norman.)
